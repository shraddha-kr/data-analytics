    "##### Character Classes\n",
    "So far, we've learned how to perform simple matches with sets, and how to use quantifiers to specify when a character should repeat a certain number of times. Let's continue by looking at a more complex example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some stories submitted to Hacker News include a topic tag in brackets, like [pdf]. Here are a few examples of story titles with these tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "[video] Google Self-Driving SUV Sideswipes Bus\n",
    "New Directions in Cryptography by Diffie and Hellman (1976) [pdf]\n",
    "Wallace and Gromit  The Great Train Chase (1993) [video]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this screen, our task is going to be to find how many titles in our dataset have tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first inclination may be to create the regex [pdf]. Unfortunately, the brackets would be interpreted as a set, so our pattern would match the single characters p, d, or f.\n",
    "Without escaping characters\n",
    "![title](./img/RegEx_8.png)\n",
    "To match the substring \"[pdf]\", we can use backslashes to escape both the open and closing brackets: \\[pdf\\].\n",
    "![title](./img/RegEx_9.png)\n",
    "The other critical part of our task of identifying how many titles have tags is knowing how to match the characters between the brackets (like pdf and video) without knowing ahead of time what the different topic tags will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "To match unknown characters using regular expressions, we use character classes. Character classes allow us to match certain groups of characters. We've actually seen two examples of character classes already:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The set notation using brackets to match any of a number of characters.\n",
    "2. The range notation, which we used to match ranges of digits (like [0-9]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a summary of syntax for some of the regex character classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](./img/RegEx_10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two new things we can observe from this table:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ranges can be used for letters as well as numbers.\n",
    "2. Sets and ranges can be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with quantifiers, there are some other common character classes which we'll use a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](./img/RegEx_11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The one that we'll be using to match characters in tags is \\w, which represents any number or letter. Each character class represents a single character, so to match multiple characters (e.g. words like video and pdf), we'll need to combine them with quantifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to match word characters between our brackets, we can combine the word character class (\\w) with the 'one or more' quantifier (+), giving us a combined pattern of \\w+.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will match sequences like pdf, video, Python, and 2018 but won't match a sequence containing a space or punctuation character like PHP-DEV or XKCD Flowchart. If we wanted to match those tags as well, we could use .+; however, in this case, we're just interested in single-word tags without special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly recap the concepts we learned in this screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can use a backslash to escape characters that have special meaning in regular expressions (e.g. \\ will match an open bracket character).\n",
    "* Character classes let us match certain groups of characters (e.g. \\w will match any word character).\n",
    "* Character classes can be combined with quantifiers when we want to match different numbers of characters.\n",
    "\n",

    " we learned that we can use backslashes to escape the [ and ] characters. Backslashes are used to escape many other characters in regular expressions, as well as to denote some special character sequences (like character classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a backslash followed by certain characters represents an escape sequence — like the \\n sequence — which we previously learned represents a new line. These escape sequences can result in unintended consequences for our regular expressions. Let's take a look at a string containing the substring \\b:\n",
    "![title](./img/RegEx_11_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "One way is to add an extra backslash before the \"b\":\n",
    "![title](./img/RegEx_11_6.png)\n",
    "This can make regular expressions even more difficult to read and interpret, so instead we use [raw strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals), which we denote by prefixing our string with the r character. Let's take a look at the code from above with a raw string:\n",
    "![title](./img/RegEx_11_7.png)\n",
    "We strongly recommend using raw strings for every regex you write, rather than remember which sequences are escape sequences and using raw strings selectively. That way, you'll never encounter a situation where you forget or overlook something which causes your regex to break.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous screen, we were able to calculate that 444 of the 20,100 Hacker News stories in our dataset contain tags. What if we wanted to find out what the text of these tags were, and how many of each are in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we'll need to use capture groups. Capture groups allow us to specify one or more groups within our match that we can access separately. In this mission, we'll learn how to use one capture group per regular expression, but in the next mission we'll learn some more complex capture group patterns.\n",
